Drinktank
=========

This is a tech demo I was asked to write for an Interview.  It uses
CSS3 animations. SASS for the win, as it makes expressing the css
less of a burden.

I used Yeoman generators to set up the project, but all the non-library
and framework code is mine. It was written over a couple of days
of caffeinated work.  The most interesting thing for me is the use
of JQuery.Deferred for the CSS3 animation scheduling.

There's a demo at http://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/54323842/drinktank/index.html
